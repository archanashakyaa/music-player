Python Music Player Application ðŸŽµ

Welcome to my Python Music Player application! This project is a simple yet functional music player built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and Pygame for audio playback.

Features
Select Folder: Choose a folder containing your favorite music files (MP3 or WAV) to play.
Play Music: Automatically plays the first music track in the selected folder.
Pause/Resume Music: Pause or resume the currently playing track with a simple click.
Stop Music: Stop the music playback at any time.
Volume Control: Adjust the volume using a slider for a personalized listening experience.
How It Works
Initialize the Player: The application initializes Pygame's mixer to handle audio and sets up a Tkinter GUI window.

Select Music Folder: Click the "Select Folder" button to open a dialog box and select a folder containing your music files.

Play Music: Once a folder is selected, the application will start playing the first track in that folder. You can see the current track's name displayed on the GUI.

Control Playback: Use the Play, Pause/Resume, and Stop buttons to control the playback of your music.

Adjust Volume: Move the volume slider to set the desired volume level for the music.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Tkinter: A built-in Python library used for creating the GUI.
Pygame: A Python library used for handling multimedia, including sound playback.
